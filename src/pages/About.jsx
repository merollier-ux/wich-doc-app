                        To understand what we’re doing at The 'Wich Doc, you have to understand where we are. Nestled smack in the middle of Vancouver Island. Parksville isn't just a GPS coordinate where we clock in, it’s where we hang our hats. Being surrounded by the kind of crushing natural beauty—the ocean, the ancient timbers—the kind that forces you to check your ego at the door. Our job isn't to reinvent the wheel, We just take our cues from the ocean and the forest right outside our back door. We buy local because it tastes better, and because it supports the people keeping this community alive. We cook to reflect the landscape. No tricks. No smoke and mirrors. Just a clean, honest expression of where we are and what we love.

                            <p>To Chef Marc, a finished dish is just the final punctuation mark on a long sentence written in sweat and logistics. They call him "The Alchemist" because he finds order in the chaos. He is a man who has spent a lifetime in the heat, mastering the transmutation of simple elements—flour, water, smoke, and meat—into something that feeds the soul.</p>
                            <p>He believes that great food is the result of a discipline that most diners will never see. His goal now is to teach the next generation that the craft isn't about ego, it's about ownership. Dedicating his time on stressing the importance of the process over the prize, he offers a simple guarantee to anyone willing to sit at his table:</p>
