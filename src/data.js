Our starter is a living member of the team.", date: "Oct 12, 2025", image: "blog1.png", content: "At The 'Wich Doc, we don't buy yeast by the pound; we cultivate it by the hour. Our sourdough starter, nicknamed 'The Patient Zero,' is a complex colony of wild bacteria and yeast harvested right here in Parksville. This slow fermentation process doesn't just provide rise; it predigests the gluten, creating a loaf that is easier on the gut and richer in micronutrients." },

We began experimenting with cold-smoking techniques using maple wood from the island. By controlling the temperature to stay below 80°F, we preserve the delicate omega-3 fatty acids while infusing a deep, smoky resonance." },

We've been analyzing the drying rates of our locally sourced pork to ensure every 'prescription' has the exact snap and salt content needed to spike your dopamine levels." }
